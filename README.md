Project Idea: Interactive Wildlife and Nature Exploration Website
Description: Build a visually immersive and educational website about nature, wildlife, and forests. The website will feature stunning visuals, animations, and interactive elements to engage users while providing interesting facts about animals, forests, and ecosystems.

Project Requirements
1. Home Page: Welcome to the Wild
Objective: Create a breathtaking introduction to nature.
Features to Implement:
A parallax scrolling effect with layers of a forest (e.g., foreground, middle ground, background).
Animated title text (e.g., "Explore the Untamed" with glowing or particle effects).
Flying birds or drifting clouds using CSS animations or JavaScript.
A "Start Exploring" button with hover effects (e.g., ripple or glowing animations).
2. Forest Ecosystem Overview
Objective: Introduce different types of forests and their characteristics.
Features to Implement:
Interactive world map where users can click on regions to learn about tropical, temperate, and boreal forests.
On-hover animations for forest icons (e.g., trees sway, animals peek out).
Use CSS clip-path to create creative shapes (e.g., tree-shaped panels for facts).
Scroll animations for facts to appear dynamically.
3. Wildlife Gallery
Objective: Showcase different species of animals.
Features to Implement:
Hover animations for animal cards (e.g., zoom-in with background blur).
On-click expand feature to show more details about the animal, including:
Habitat
Diet
Fun facts
Animated SVG or Lottie animations for icons (e.g., paw print, leaf).
4. Explore a Forest Section
Objective: Simulate walking through a forest.
Features to Implement:
Use horizontal scrolling to simulate movement through a forest scene.
Include interactive hotspots (e.g., click on a tree to learn about it or on an animal to hear its sound).
Background animations like flowing streams, rustling leaves, or fireflies glowing.
Use audio effects for immersive experiences (e.g., chirping birds, rustling leaves).
5. Threats to Nature
Objective: Raise awareness about environmental threats.
Features to Implement:
Create a dynamic infographics section with scroll-triggered animations (e.g., bars rising, icons appearing).
Add CSS transitions for smooth updates when switching between facts.
Include a "How You Can Help" section with animated action buttons.
6. Nature Quiz
Objective: Make the learning process fun and engaging.
Features to Implement:
Quiz questions about animals, forests, and environmental conservation.
Interactive progress bar for the quiz.
Add animations for correct/incorrect answers (e.g., confetti or a red X).
A reward animation (e.g., an animated badge or fireworks) for completing the quiz.
7. Contact and Support Section
Objective: Allow users to connect or contribute.
Features to Implement:
Interactive form with focus animations (e.g., field highlights or moving labels).
Animated call-to-action buttons for donations or volunteer sign-ups.
Social media icons with hover effects.
